## Introduction
This will be used as a sample to display some of my analytical capabilities in R. This project will demonstrate how useful R can be to perform analysis that is easy to reproduce and communicate. This is by no means an exhaustive demonstration of my proficiency with R, but should highlight common data analysis functions that I perform regularly.

## Analysis Goals
I have little to no knowledge about Formula One racing. My only insight prior to conducting this analysis is that Lewis Hamilton is one of the best drivers to ever touch a steering wheel. My goal for this project is to analyze the data to increase my knowledge of the sport and its participants. After conducting my EDA I plan on creating a model that can be used to predict a driver's probability of finishing 3rd or higher in their next race.

## R Shiny Dashboard
Coming soon...

## Data Sources
The data used for this analysis contains a wide range of information related to Formula One races from 1950 through 2017. The data are currently separated into various tables. Part of this exercise will require me to verify the accuracy of the data and combine the tables into a more easy to interpret format. The data used for this analysis can be found at the following Kaggle link. <br>
[F1 Race Data](https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017)

```

## Data Wrangling/Cleansing
### Data Inspection

Now that the data is loaded I can begin to inspect it to determine if any transformations will be needed before I can conduct further analysis. 
```{r}
glimpse(drivers)
```

I will repeat this process with the other tables using the following method.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
map(list(circuits, constructor_results, constructors,
         constructor_standings, drivers, driver_standings,
         lap_times, pit_stops, pit_stops,
         qualifying, races, results,
         seasons, status), glimpse)
```
### Data Cleansing

As expected the data need to be cleaned. There are unneeded fields for links to Wikipedia pages, missing data in fields, redundant variables, and datetime issues that need to be resolved. The next couple of sections will focus on the transformations needed to clean the data.

```{r}
results %>%
  #Removes the redundant positionText variable
  select(-positionText) %>%
  #Converts the fastestLapTime and race time variables to hms
  mutate(fastestLapTime = hms::as_hms(paste0("00:", str_sub(paste0(fastestLapTime), start = 1, end = 5))),
         f_time = hms::as_hms(as_datetime(milliseconds(milliseconds)))) %>%
  #Removes the updated variables
  select(-time, -milliseconds) -> results

drivers %>%
  #Removing the driverRef variable since it usually the same as the surname
  #Removing the number and code variables becuase they aren't available for all drivers
  select(-c(driverRef, number, code, url)) %>%
  #Converts the dob variable to date format
  mutate(dob = dmy(dob)) -> drivers

#Some of the circuit names and locations contain characters that weren't formatted correctly
#These update are used to correct the circuit name issues
circuits[18, 3] <- "Autódromo José Carlos Pace"
circuits[20, 3] <- "Nürburgring"
circuits[20, 4] <- "Nürburg"
circuits[4, 4] <- "Montmeló"
circuits[25, 3] <- "Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez"
circuits[27, 3] <- "Autódromo do Estoril"
circuits[32, 3] <- "Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez"
circuits[36, 3] <- "Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet"
circuits[49, 3] <- "Montjuïc"

#Removes unneeded variables
circuits %>%
  select(-c(circuitRef, alt, url)) -> circuits

#Removes unneeded variables
constructors %>%
  rename(c_name = name, c_nationality = nationality) %>%
  select(-c(constructorRef, url, X6)) -> constructors

#Renames the pit stop duration variable
pit_stops %>%
  mutate(ps_duration = as.numeric(duration)) %>%
  select(-c(duration, milliseconds)) -> pit_stops

#Updates the variable names and removes the url variable
races %>%
  rename(race_year = year, race_round = round, race_name = name, race_date = date,
         race_time = time) %>%
  select(-url) -> races

#Uses the milliseconds column to calculate the lap times in hms format
lap_times %>%
  mutate(l_time = hms::as_hms(as_datetime(milliseconds(milliseconds)))) %>%
  select(-c(time, milliseconds)) -> lap_times
  
```

The rest of the tables contain either unneeded or redundant information that can be imputed by using other available information.

```{r}
rm(constructor_results, constructor_results, constructor_standings, driver_standings, qualifying, seasons)

```

### Data Validation

The last step before combining the various tables is to validate the accuracy of the information that they hold. A quick Wikipedia search returns information that should assist with this process. Validating the data allows me to have greater confidence in the accuracy of my analysis and predictions. I can also use the statistics that I am going to calculate to check my data once it's joined.  <br>

First up are the `results` and `drivers` tables. I'm choosing to examine a driver who was retired before the last date that the data was collected. That way I can confirm if the data capture all necessary win statistics to calculate a variety of driver stats.

```{r}
results %>%
  left_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  filter(surname %in% c("Prost", "Schumacher"), 
         forename %in% c("Alain", "Michael")) %>%
  group_by(forename, surname) %>%
  mutate(win = if_else(position == 1, 1, 0),
         podium = if_else(position %in% c(1:3), 1, 0),
         #Total career wins
         career_wins = sum(win, na.rm = TRUE), 
         #Total career podiums(placed 3rd of higher)
         career_podium = sum(podium, na.rm = TRUE),
         #Total career points(including non Championship points)
         total_points = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(forename, surname, career_wins, career_podium, total_points) %>%
  distinct()

results %>%
  select(raceId, driverId, constructorId) %>%
  left_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  left_join(constructors, by = "constructorId") %>%
  filter(driverId %in% c(30, 117)) %>%
  group_by(forename, surname) %>%
  distinct(c_name) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(surname)

```

So far so good. The values for the `career_wins`, `career_podium`, and `total_points` variables all match the values found on wikipedia for the drivers shown below. I have also confirmed the various constructors that each driver raced for during their career. I'll repeat this process for other variables in the remaining tables. 

```{r, out.width = "550px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Project Images/driver_stats.png")

```
<br>

Digging a little deeper into the `lap_times` and `races` tables reveal that the laptime data is only available for races after March, 3rd 1996. Using the same methodology to inspect the `pit_stops` table shows that it only has data back to 2011. There is still enough complete data from the other tables to conduct some insightful exploratory analysis but the lack of complete lap specific data could prove limiting when trying to build a model. I will have to keep the limitations of these two tables in mind.
```{r}
lap_times %>%
  left_join(races, by = "raceId") %>%
  summarize(oldest_race = min(race_date)) 

pit_stops %>%
  left_join(races, by = "raceId") %>%
  summarize(oldest_race = min(race_date))

races %>%
  summarize(oldest_race = min(race_date))

```

### Joining the Tables

The final step before I can begin analyzing and visualizing the data is to join all of these tables into a master table. This will also make model creation creation and testing easier. 

```{r}
results %>%
  select(-c(resultId, number)) %>%
  left_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  left_join(races, by = "raceId") %>%
  left_join(constructors, by = "constructorId") %>%
  left_join(circuits, by = "circuitId") %>%
  left_join(status, by = "statusId") -> master_table

```

The data within the `lap_times` and `pit_stops` tables  will need to be summarized from the lap level to the race level before they can be joined to the `master_table`. I've chosen create a more precise `fastestLap` variable, and add a variable to record the driver with fastest time. I also created summary stats for total pits stops in a race, total pit stop duration, and average pit stop duration.

```{r}
lap_times %>%
  mutate(l_num = as.numeric(l_time)) %>%
  group_by(raceId, driverId) %>%
  top_n(-1, l_num) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(raceId, driverId, position, l_time) %>%
  rename(fl_position = position, fastestLapTime = l_time) %>%
  group_by(raceId) %>%
  mutate(fastestDriverTime = hms::as_hms(min(fastestLapTime))) %>%
  ungroup() -> f_lap_times

pit_stops %>%
  group_by(raceId, driverId) %>%
  summarize(total_stops = sum(stop),
            total_p_duration = sum(ps_duration),
            avg_p_duration = mean(ps_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) -> total_stops

master_table %>%
  select(-fastestLapTime) %>%
  left_join(f_lap_times, by = c("raceId", "driverId")) %>%
  left_join(total_stops, by = c("raceId", "driverId")) -> master_table

```

## Data Analysis

Now comes the fun part! With all of my data combined to a single table I can be begin my exploratory analysis and increase my knowledge of the sport. 

### Most Wins

Given the tidy format of our data it is easy to identify and produce some quick stats on the top 5 drivers by win count. It's pretty clear that finishing in first place isn't easy considering that the top two drivers are barely at a 30% win percentage. It's also very impressive that Alain Prost still sits within the top 3 even though his last race was over 2 decades ago! It's crazy to think that anyone who has watched Lewis Hamilton race was more likely to see him place in the top 3 than not.

```{r}
master_table %>%
  mutate(race_win = if_else(position == 1, TRUE, FALSE),
         podium = if_else(position %in% c(1:3), TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(forename, surname) %>%
  summarize(total_wins = sum(race_win, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_podium = sum(podium, na.rm = TRUE),
            last_race = max(race_date),
            total_races = n(),
            win_perc = percent(total_wins / total_races),
            podium_perc = percent(total_podium / total_races)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-forename) %>%
  top_n(5, total_wins) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_wins)) %>%
  print.data.frame()
  
```

### Constructor Performance Over Time

Next up is a bar plot that summarizes the top 3 constructors by podiums for each decade. Its clear from this graph that Ferrari was dominating the sport in the 50's and 2000's. Now it seems that Mercedes is the constructor to beat for a majority of the 2010's.

```{r, fig.width=10}
master_table %>%
  mutate(podium = if_else(position %in% c(1:3), 1, 0),
         decade = cut(race_year, breaks = seq(1949, 2019, 10),
                      labels = seq(1950, 2010, 10))) %>%
  group_by(c_name, decade) %>%
  summarize(decade_podium = sum(podium, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(c_name) %>%
  mutate(total_podium = sum(decade_podium, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  #Couldn't use top_n becasue I needed to utilize the dense_rank window rank function
  mutate(p_rank = dense_rank(decade_podium),
         max_rank = max(p_rank)) %>%
  filter(p_rank > max_rank - 3, c_name != "Cooper-Climax") %>%
  ggplot(aes(as.integer(as.character(decade)), decade_podium, fill = factor(decade))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2(width = 0.8, preserve = "single")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, 10)) + scale_fill_npg() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 210)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = c_name, group = c_name), position = position_dodge(width = 9), hjust = -0.01, size = 3, angle = 45) +
  labs(x = "Decade", y = "Podium Count", fill = "Decade")

```


### Median Race Time

This chart illustrates the change in median finish time over they years for the top three circuits with the most races. There is a clear trend as cars and drivers have gotten faster over time. There are some sudden increases in the graph that seem a little counter intuitive. This graph is also assuming that a given circuit has stayed the same in terms of distance and difficulty. I would need more data to control for these variables.


```{r, fig.width=10}
master_table %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(total_races = n_distinct(raceId)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(name, race_year, total_races) %>%
  summarize(med_time = median(f_time, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(r_rank = dense_rank(total_races),
         max_rank = max(r_rank)) %>%
  filter(r_rank > max_rank - 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(race_year, med_time, col = factor(name))) + geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, 10)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Finish Time", col = "Circuit") +
  scale_color_npg()

```

### Race Locations

From the graphs I can see that Formula One really is a global sport, even though certain regions do hold more races than others. It's clear that a large amount of races take place in Europe. The second graph zooms into Western Europe to show the dispursion of races across that region.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=7}
#Remove Antartica from the map
map_data("world") %>%
  filter(region != "Antarctica") -> world_data

#Creates a table containg the total number of races per country
master_table %>%
  group_by(name, lat, lng, country) %>%
  summarize(race_count = n_distinct(raceId)) -> rc_count_ll

ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = world_data, map = world_data,
           aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region),
           fill = "#a8a8a8", color = "#ffffff", size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(data = rc_count_ll, aes(x = lng, y = lat, size = race_count), 
             col = "red") +
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 7)) +
  labs(size = "Race Count", title = "Total Races by Country (Global)") +
  theme(axis.title=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=9}
european_countries %>%
  filter(Country != "Russia") %>%
  mutate(Country = recode(Country, "United Kingdom" = "UK")) %>%
  pull() -> european_countries_formatted
  
world_data %>%
  filter(region %in% european_countries_formatted) -> europe_data

rc_count_ll %>%
  semi_join(europe_data %>%
              select(region),
            by = c("country" = "region")) -> rc_count_ll_eu

ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = europe_data, map = europe_data,
           aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region),
           fill = "#949494", color = "#ffffff", size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(data = rc_count_ll_eu, aes(x = lng, y = lat, size = race_count), 
             col = "red") +
  labs(size = "Race Count", title = "Total Races by Country (Europe)") +
  scale_radius(range = c(1.5, 10)) +
  theme(axis.title=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

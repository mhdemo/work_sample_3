## Introduction
This will be used as a sample to display some of my analytical capabilities in R. This project will demonstrate how useful R can be to perform analysis that is easy to reproduce and communicate. This is by no means an exhaustive demonstration of my proficiency with R, but should highlight common data analysis functions that I perform regularly.
